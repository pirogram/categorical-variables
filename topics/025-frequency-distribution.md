title: Frequency Distribution
--- |

  While standing outside your house, sipping coffee and watching the cars go by, you decided to note the maker of the car, every time a car passed by. Here are the observations you made:

  ```
  Volvo, Mercedez, Mercedez, Toyota, Honda, Toyota, Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Volvo
  ```

  If you think of `Car Maker` as a categorical variable, you can summarize this dataset as follows:

  | Car Maker | Frequency |
  | - | - |
  | Volvo | 2 |
  | Mercedez | 2 |
  | Toyota | 3 |
  | Honda | 2 |
  | Lexus | 1 |

  This summary is called the _frequency distribution_ of `Car Maker` variable. The most common way to visualize it is the bar chart.
